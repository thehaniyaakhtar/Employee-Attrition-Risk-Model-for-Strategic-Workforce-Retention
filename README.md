## 🔍 Overview  
This project helps Salifort Motors identify employees at risk of leaving the company by analyzing HR data and building a predictive model. The solution enables the HR team to make **proactive, data-informed decisions** that reduce turnover and improve employee retention.

## 💼 Business Impact  
Replacing an employee is expensive and disruptive. With this model, HR can:  
- Predict attrition before it happens  
- Understand key factors driving resignations  
- Design retention strategies tailored to high-risk groups  

This directly reduces recruitment costs and safeguards institutional knowledge.

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques  
- **Python**: Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Feature Engineering**: Tenure-to-age ratio, satisfaction metrics, encoded job roles  
- **Class Imbalance Handling**: SMOTE  
- **Modeling**: Logistic Regression for stakeholder interpretability  
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy, Recall, Confusion Matrix  

## 📈 Key Results  
- Identified top attrition drivers: **job satisfaction**, **overtime**, **project load**  
- Built a classification model to predict attrition likelihood  
- Delivered insights to HR for immediate policy evaluation and change  

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated  
- Framing business problems into machine learning solutions  
- Constructing interpretable models with clear communication value  
- Creating data narratives for non-technical stakeholders
